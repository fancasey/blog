## Hello again!
Don't worry guys, I didn't forget about the blog. It's just been a hot minute and I had other things on my mind, but we're back now! And to make up for the lack of blog posts, I've updated the site! It might be a downgrade in some people's eyes, but I think if I explain the changes, you'll appreciate what I've done with this space.
## Rationale
I'll be honest: when I made the first iteration of this site, a lot of it was just copy and paste from the internet. Do you know how many tutorials there are on how to make a blog with React? Too many to count. Anyway, I found some tutorial that used Next.js, md files, and one js file, and basically word for word copy pasted it in, all while changing some html/css to make it look pretty in my eyes. I learned a lot, but I still had no idea what was REALLY going on (I just looked over the code and convinced myself I knew what was going on, which is not the same). On top of that, my code was really a mess: I didn't have any uniformity/structure, I used tailwind too much, and I was scared I was going to break the whole thing whenever I went to make any change, including just adding a simple blog post. So I've decided I wanted to start from scratch, and really give making this blog an honest try without copying and pasting too much code.
## Aesthetic changes
I originally was inspired to make my site like those [penguin classic books](https://www.penguin.com/penguin-classics-overview/), but with a little more color to show that I'm not like everyone else. I still like how it looked, but I think the blue and yellow was a little bit much and I admitted that I was no designer, so I opted for a much simpler aesthetic. Simple light and dark (oh, I also have support for light/dark themes!), pastel colors that are yellow/purple kind of like the day and night cycle, with the sun and the dark night sky. I think the page looks more professional now, but I guess that's up to the individual to see.

## Technical changes
Since I don't really know what was going on before, I can't speak to how things have changed, but now I've chosen what I'm using a little bit more carefully, so I can speak to those technologies better. I think before I was using the page router of Next.js, which is not recommended, so I switched to the app router for this project. To be honest, I feel like the page router is more intuitive, but I'll still to what's recommended and what is 'up to date' so to speak. I definitely took better advantage of css files (like globals.css) instead of just putting in custom tailwind for everythingâ€“this should hopefully make things much more extensible and easier to read for those going through my repo. We're also now transitioned to 100% typescript, which is wonderful, but still many things are typed as any, so it's a process I guess. Going along with that, the logic for getting blog posts, slugs, and sorting blog posts is mostly done by me (assisted by my good friend ChatGPT), and I have a much better understanding of what's going on under the hood now. Also, I've moved onto mdx instead of md, even though I think before I had the mdx package installed (I'm not sure what for). It's really great that I get to use jsx INSIDE my markdown files, and it's also a very cool way to implement frontmatter without installing another package (I learned that from the Next.js website). Also, I don't know if I learned anything, but I'm a little bit less scared to use git now (this has also been helped by my classes, both of which used github classroom).

Yeah, I think that's about it. Anyway, I hope to be using this blog a bit more to share about things I'm doing (upcoming projects, research) as a way to reinforce what I'm learning: after all, teaching is the best way to learn or something like that!
