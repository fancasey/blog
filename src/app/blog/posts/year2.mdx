## First, a quick update to the site.
Yeah, so I added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. Also, I changed the posts on mobile so that it's not so squished and made it so when you hover over the links up top, it makes them underlined. This took my longer than I thought it would and to be honest I think I abused Tailwind too much, but overall I'm happy with the changes.

## Ok, so now let's talk about my sophomore year.
I think this year I made many real steps toward doing what I want. First, I figured out what I want–and to be completely honest this still isn't 100% and I tell people I'm figuring stuff out, but I've been taking classes and figuring out different fields and have some idea: post grad, I'd like to go to grad school for more theoretical CS, in quantum computing.

So you know, what were these steps that I'm talking about? Well this year I still wasn't completely sure what I wanted, so I applied for research and applied to SWE/AI internships, having little to no experience in either of the three. I also reached out to some people about research, both QC and not. First off, I learned through everything that I am NOT prepared enough for these positions, both as a researcher and as an intern. I had this idea that internships would take someone with basically no practical/deployed experience (I mean that's what I am) and that if you're from a relatively prestigious school, you'd have a good shot of getting *something*, but I learned that this was very much not the case. Through applied to hundreds of roles and talking with my friends, I realized that I should've been doing WAY more outside of school (personal projects, clubs, etc), and that these roles are extremely selective. I mean I only got a few interviews (single digits for sure, maybe under 5) and 0 offers. All of this wasn't helped by the fact that I had little motivation and started pretty late, and didn't network with anyone.

So yeah, not very successful on that front. And I said earlier that I wanted to do grad school/research after I graduate, but I don't have any experience there either. So what's my justification? I think I mentioned this in my freshman reflection post, too, but last spring I took a class in linear algebra along with a discrete math/algorithms class, and while neither of those classes were proof-based, they had some proofs, and I really enjoyed those classes. So I enrolled in a proof-based math class (differential equations) as well as a proofwriting class this fall. Those were both really good; I thought the pace was going to be too fast for me and too abstract, but the math department here is very nice–both in their grading and their mannerisms. But yeah, I really like the security of proofs and the generality of statements in math; it feels like there's potential for very little memorization (as long as the proofs of theorems in class come to you super easily, which I can't say is the case for me), which is also nice. Honestly, I think I didn't need to take the proofwriting class and I would've been OK, as the discrete math class I took in the spring covered much of the same material (that said, review is always healthy). This spring, I took two more math classes, and while the course reviews said they were easy, I approached them with caution and enrolled in fewer credit hours than the norm. I think they ended up being easier than I thought they would be, but also nowhere near as easy as the reviews said. So anyway, I guess I figured that since I enjoyed the *why* of my math classes, I'd probably enjoy theory and research, too. So I applied to some research internships over the summer and got some offers (woohoo!), and also was talking to a professor during the fall/spring about QC research, but that eventually fell through because I wasn't prepared enough basically (in terms of quantum knowledge). I did end up talking with one of my math professors and joining her research group for next fall, and it's in graph theory/combinatorics/coding theory, so very close to CS stuff, but not necessarily QC. As for my quantum journey, I enrolled for a QC course next fall which requires quantum knowledge as a prereq, so I'll be forced to learn this summer. So it feels like I'm heading in some direction now, which is a nice feeling.

This summer is gonna be a lot: I'm taking a class, doing a research internship, self-studying to prepare for classes, and working on personal projects. I don't know if I'll be able to handle it all, but I'm definitely excited to try.
