This is partly my first post and partly a test; maybe I'll change it later. Probably not.

## So what is this?
My intention is to make a personal/professional blog. I'll (hopefully) post whatever I feel here, kinda like a more filtered journal. Right now, I'm considering writing about:
- academic interests
- hobbies
- how I'm feeling at the moment
- fun things (like vacations or events)
  
## Why?
Before this winter break, I realized I didn't really have anything on my resume. So this is a personal project to pass the time and supplement my 'portfolio.' I'm not really interested in webdev as a career, but I feel like most personal projects end up being web development projects and I think it's a valuable skill to have in general, even if just at a basic level. It's been fun so far, even though I'm really just following tutorials.
